**Webhook plugin for Dockerhub**

> SpaceONE's [plugin-aws-sns-monitoring-webhook](https://github.com/spaceone-dev/plugin-aws-sns-mon-webhook) 
 is a tool that can integrate and manage events of various patterns from various AWS alert services.   
> SpaceONE already supports various external monitoring ecosystems in the form of plug-ins   
> (Prometheus, Grafana, Zabbix, etc), and SNS webhook is one of them, which more reliably supports events of AWS alert services.
